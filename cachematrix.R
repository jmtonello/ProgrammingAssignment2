## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may 
## be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than 
## compute it repeatedly.
## The folowing functions cache the inverse of a matrix


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inverse <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inverse <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        
        setInverse <- function(y) inverse <<- y
        getInverse <- function() inverse
        
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned 
## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

        inverse <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(inverse)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inverse)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inverse <- solve(data)
        x$setInverse(inverse)
        inverse
}
